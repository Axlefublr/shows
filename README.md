# What is this?

This is my personal repo with various entertainment media I want to track

MAL is something I never use, and I don't tend to like creating lists on websites that may soon perish

# But nobody cares!

Why are you reading this then? 🤨

## Shows.json

Json file modified automatically via my terminal for shows I'm currently watching

## ToConsume

Media I want to consume, but have yet to start

## Finished

Media I finished watching

## Dropped

Media I dropped or put on hold

If I almost finished a show a long time ago and don't intend to return to it (I already caught all the spoilers), generally it will be considered watched (example: Breaking Bad)
